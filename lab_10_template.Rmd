```

# PART 1. Correlation matrix (World Bank world environmental factors data)

Compiled World Bank data, accessed from: https://www.kaggle.com/zanderventer/environmental-variables-for-world-countries#World_countries_env_vars.csv  

Create a correlation matrix to explore colinearity

- Read in the "world_env_vars.csv file" as env_var
- Find correlations between all variables, columns 2:28
- Plot the correlation matrix (corrplot)

```{r env_corr, echo = FALSE}
# read in csv and remove NA so that you can use cor()
# do complete case deletion: all rows with NA values are deleted
env_var <- read_csv("world_env_vars.csv") %>% 
  na.omit

# calculate Pearson's r for correlations
# find correlations between all columns in env_var except column 1 (country name)
cor_df <- cor(env_var[2:28])

# use corrplot() in corrplot package to make correlation matrix
corrplot(cor_df)
# size of circles and transparency indicate strength of correlation, color indicates directionality

# update corrplot to be easier to use
corrplot(cor_df,
         # only upper correlation matrix
         type = "upper",
         # ellipse direction indicates direction of correlation
         method = "ellipse",
         # make text black
         tl.col = "black",
         # space out text
         tl.cex = 0.5)

# more narrow = more strongly correlated
# right = negative correlation, left = positive correlation
# red = negative correlation, blue = positive correlation
# light = weak correlation, dark = strong correlation
```

# PART 2. Binary Logistic Regression (Donner Party Data)

Use the 'glm' function for fitting *generalized linear models* (the *logit* - log odds of survival, in our case, will be linearly related to Sex and Age. So we expect the final model to look something like this: 

$$Log Odds (Survival) = \beta_0 + \beta_1(Age) + \beta_2(Sex)$$

We'll use 'family = binomial' to run binomial logistic regression...otherwise, this looks very similar to other types of regression we've already done.  

**Question:** What effect do age and sex have on survivorship in the Donner party?

a. Read in the DonnerTable.csv file as DonnerTable

```{r donner_data, include = FALSE}
# read in csv
DonnerTable <- read_csv("DonnerTable.csv")
```

**Important:** When outcome dependent variable is already coded as 0/1, it's easy to define probability of outcome A or B. If you have a binary dependent variable is true/false, you need to figure out how R codes each as 0 or 1. The easiest way to know which is which is to specify on your own (using `r casewhen()`) so that there's no confusion about what you are defining as 0 or 1.  

b. Binomial logistic regression

```{r blr, echo = FALSE}
# use glm() to set up model
donner_blr <- glm(Outcome ~ Sex + Age, 
                  # choose the type of model you're constructing
                  family = "binomial",
                  # call data that you're using
                  data = DonnerTable)

summary(donner_blr)
# looking at intercepts, male survival is lower than female survival AND an increase in age leads to a decrease in the odds of survival
```

c. Use the model to answer: What are the log odds of survival for a 5 year-old female? The probability of survival?

```{r predict_f_5}

# 1. Create a data frame with variables Sex and Age, containing data "Female" and 5, respectively: 

# create a new data frame for a female of age 5
# data has to have the exact same variable names as the model you're using in order for things to match up
f_5 <- data.frame(Sex = "Female", Age = 5)


# 2. Find the log odds of survival for the new data (5 year old female) using predict() function with type = "link":

# give predict() model name
f_5_logodds <- predict(donner_blr, 
                       # new data frame
                       newdata = f_5,
                       # calculate log odds
                       type = "link")
f_5_logodds


# 3. Exponentiate the log odds to find ODDS of survival for a 5 year old female:

# figure out actual odds of survival for 5 year old female
f_5_odds <- exp(f_5_logodds)
f_5_odds
# odds are 4.23:1, odds of survival for 5 year old female ~80% BUT you can do this by writing in type = "response"

# Ask: Could we manually find the probability of survival for a 5-year old female? recall: p/(1-p) = ODDS



# 4. Actually, let's just use type = "response" in the predict function, which converts to a probability for us:

f_5_prob <- predict(donner_blr, 
                       # new data frame
                       newdata = f_5,
                       # calculate probability of survival
                       type = "response")
f_5_prob
```

d. What is the probability of survival for a 25 year-old male? 

```{r predict_m_25}

# Similarly:

m_25 <- data.frame(Sex = "Male", Age = 25) # Make a new data frame

m_25_prob <- predict(donner_blr, newdata = m_25, type = "response") # Find probability of survival
m_25_prob
```

e. Create new sequences of data so that we can graph probabilities for the entire spectrum of ages, designated by sex.

```{r new_data}
# create a data frame of new data to feed into model and make predictions

seq_age <- rep(seq(from = 0, to = 100), 2) # Create a sequence from 0 to 100, twice (one will be "Male" and one will be "Female")

f_101 <- rep("Female", 101) # Repeat 'Female' 101 times (to match years data)
m_101 <- rep("Male", 101) # Repeat 'Male' 101 times
mf_101 <- c(f_101, m_101) # Combine them into a single vector

# Combine the age and sex sequences into a single data frame - that will be the new data that we have our model make predictions for

donner_newdata <- data.frame(seq_age, mf_101) # MUST make column names match variables in the model!
colnames(donner_newdata) <- c("Age","Sex")
```

f. Now that we have new data to put into our model to have it make predictions, let's go ahead and actually find the predicted probabilities for each Age/Sex combination.

```{r donner_predict}

# Find probabilities using predict (with type = "response"). Include SE.

predicted_probs <- predict(donner_blr,
                           newdata = donner_newdata,
                           type = "response",
                           # calculates standard error with each prediction
                           se.fit = TRUE)
predicted_probs
# doesn't include info to make those predictions

# Coerce outcome into data frame. 

# make new data frame with donner_newdata, the prediction for probability of survival, and the standard error for each prediction
graph_data <- data.frame(donner_newdata, predicted_probs$fit, predicted_probs$se.fit)
# rename column names
colnames(graph_data) <- c("Age", "Sex", "Probability", "SE")
```

g. Graph results.

```{r donner_graph, echo = FALSE}
donner_graph <- ggplot(graph_data, aes(x = Age, y = Probability)) +
  # add color to be dependent on sex to group data
  geom_line(aes(color = Sex)) +
  # add ribbon of SE
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = Probability - SE, 
                  ymax = Probability + SE,
                  # group by sex
                  fill = Sex),
              # add transparency to be able to see predicted line
              alpha = 0.4)
  
donner_graph
```


# PART 3. Solar irradiation at the 3 locations in 2010 (pull in all together, do some lubridate stuff, etc.)

a. Read in multiple solar irradiation files (for SB (CA), Hilo (HI), and Fairbanks (AK)):
```{r solar_data, include = FALSE}
# read in all files as one data frame
# first, make a list of file names for anything that starts with solar_irradiation, put in a wildcard
si_full <- list.files(pattern = "solar_irradiation_*") %>% 
  # read in files then map to put in single data frame
  map_df(~read_csv(.)) %>% 
  # cleans up your column names to snake case!!!!
  clean_names()

# resulting data frame contains all data from 3 files in one data frame
# original files had a column to specify sites so that when the data are merged, you know where it came from
```

b. Wrangle the data
```{r wrangle_solar}
solar_tidy <- si_full %>% 
  # rename columns to make it easier to call columns
  rename(sol_rad = etr_wh_m_2,
         date = yyyy_mm_dd,
         time = hh_mm_lst) %>% 
  # remove NA values from time
  filter(time != "NA") %>% 
  # reorder things so that they aren't set alphabetically with fct_relevel() in forcats package
  mutate(site = fct_relevel(site, "Hawaii", "Santa Barbara", "Alaska"))
```

c. Use lubridate() functions to convert to times/dates
```{r date_time}
# recognize column solar_tidy$date as a date, and reorder data as month-day-year
solar_tidy$date <- mdy(solar_tidy$date)

# recognize column solar_tidy$time as time, reorder data as hours-minutes-seconds
solar_tidy$time <- hms(solar_tidy$time)
```

d. Make an awesome figure of solar irradiation (heat/tile map)
```{r solar_graph}
solar_gg <- ggplot(solar_tidy, aes(x = date, y = time)) +
  # geom_tile: color depends on value that you give it
  geom_tile(aes(fill = sol_rad)) +
  # scale_fill_gradientn lets you choose as many colors as you want to be in your gradient scheme
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = c("royalblue2", "mediumorchid1", "orange", "yellow")) +
  # specify that the y axis is supposed to be time
  scale_y_time() +
  # wrap by site, force outcomes into their own rows
  facet_wrap(~ site, ncol = 1)

solar_gg
```


#PART 4. gganimate example: total aquaculture production (metric tons) for United States, Brazil, Chile, and Ecuador

a. Get the data, and do some wrangling:
```{r aqua_data}
aq_df <- read_csv("aq_wb.csv")
# data are in wide format (data for all different years are in one column), not tidy format

aq_tidy <- aq_df %>% 
  filter(country == "Brazil" |
           country == "Chile" |
           country == "Ecuador" |
           country == "United States") %>% 
  
  # use gather() in tidyr to create two new columns called year and aq_prod
  # takes column headers that you're gathering to put into the first column called "year"
  gather(year, 
          # then takes all those values and puts into the other column called "aq_prod"
         aq_prod, 
          # use back ticks so that R recognizes that those are column names, not numbers
         `1960`:`2016`) %>% 
  
  # only years after 1990
  filter(year >= 1990) %>%
  mutate(aq_mil = aq_prod/1000000) %>% 
  select(country, year, aq_mil)
```


b. Read in the fish.png as 'fish'

```{r fish_image}
fish <- "fish.png"
```

c. Make a graph...with gganimate!
```{r gganimate_fish}
# have to coerce year to numeric because it used to be column names so R would think it's full of characters
aq_plot <- ggplot(aq_tidy, aes(x = as.numeric(year), y = aq_mil), group = country) +
  # in the line graph, want to assign color to country
  geom_line(aes(color = country)) +
  # add a picture of a fish at each point
  geom_image(aes(image = fish)) +
  # label each line for country, and make the color of the label different by country
  geom_text(aes(label = country, color = country),
            # change position of the label and make label bigger
            position = position_nudge(y = 0.04, x = 1), size = 5) +
  # in gganimate
  transition_reveal(country, as.numeric(year))

aq_plot
```
